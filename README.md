# DataCleaning@Coursera Assignment

This repo is created for final assignment, of ["Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project). It gets human activity recognition data from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), and transforms them into one tidy dataset.
